### Software Engineering Project for COMP6640001

#### Our project connects hospitals, insurance companies, and patients to ensure faster medical claims and deter fraud claims:
- For Hospitals:

The software stores the treatment data of each patient where doctors can update patients' treatment.
After the patient has recovered, the software will calculate all treatment costs that can be viewed by both the insurance company and the patient.

- For Insurance Companies:

Insurance companies that have registered to use the software can input the various insurance policies that they offer to their customer. They can synchronize the data of their members with the software. These data include: (Name, DOB, NIK, Policy Number, Policy Benefits, etc.)
Through the web application, insurance companies can monitor the treatments administered to the patient. They can directly see the drugs or treatment plans that the patient has taken. Whether they are covered by the insurance plan is dictated by the terms and conditions of the insurance policies.

- For users:

The mobile application acts as a platform for the user to register an account using their credentials and their registered insurance policy.
After registration, users (as patients) can walk into a hospital that has partnered with the system and scan a QR code to notify the hospital that they are a member of a certain insurance company that also uses the system.
This is also the time when hospitals can verify the identity of the user to prevent fraudulent use of insurance benefits by certain individuals
